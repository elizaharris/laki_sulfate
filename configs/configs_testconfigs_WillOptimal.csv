temp,0,20,NaN,Temperature (deg C) for oxidation (determines fractionation factors); min and max (uniform distribution)
frac_oxidised_bcg_tot,0.9,NaN,NaN,Fraction of background SO2 that is oxidised (if this is too low we can't easily converge with background isotopic composition)
d34S_bcgSO2,5,1,NaN,mean and sd - mixes with volc - Value is with significant marine contribution - might need refinement

full_volc_length,1.2,NaN,NaN,Years over which the volcanic influence is evident in the ice core; length of simulation
decay_rate,0.001,NaN,NaN,Decay rate for volcanic SO2: This defines how fast the SO2 is removed (see code for details)
so2_emission_length,60,NaN,NaN,Days between start of eruption and emissions decreasing strongly (based roughly on Schmidt et al. www.atmos-chem-phys.net/10/6025/2010/ who state that Laki was most vigourous for 1.5 months
